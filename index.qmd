This is the new website to host R teaching materials for the Cleveland Clinic Molecular Medicine PhD students. It is in the very early stages of development and very much a work in progress.

The material will be split across 5 1-hour sessions as part of the Tools course, followed by 2 2-hour sessions as part of the Biostatistics and Epidemiology course.

## Tools course

### Session 1

- Introduction to the tools

    - R
    - RStudio
    - Posit Workbench
    
- Things to know about R (?)

    - Case sensitive
    - Variable names (janitor)
    - Executing code
    - Getting help
    - The pipe operator
    - R projects
    - here package/reproducibility more generally?

- Installing and loading R packages

    - CRAN
    - Github
    - Bioconductor

- Loading data

    - .xlsx
    - .csv
    - Other formats

### Session 2

- Basic programming

    - Assigning objects
